# Chatbot

This project is an AI chatbot developed with Python using the bigram learning model followed by a self-attention transformer model, following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=U23EW0zKkTpJCBUD) using  [different data](human_chat.txt). It will be implemented into the Handler One Discord Bot project [here](https://github.com/3r1cZ/Handler-One).

## Things Learned
* How to use Jupyter Notebook
* How to use the PyTorch framework to organize and generate data
* How to develop very simple machine learning algorithms such as the bigram learning model
* How to develop a transformer model using the self-attention mechanism
